# React Groceries

## TASK

Build an app that let's you make a list of groceries to buy

### Learning Objectives

* Practice setting up a React app
* Practice Mocking a React app
* Practice using state
* Practice rendering a list
* Practice conditional rendering

### Prerequisites

* Introduction to React static components, mocking, state, rendering

### Technical Requirements

Read over these specs and draw a mockup of your app (don't worry about bonus features at this point)

* Must have grocery items in this shape
```
{
  item: '',
  brand '',
  units: '',
  quantity: 0,
  isPurchased: false
}
```

* Make an array of 3 objects using the above shape and render the item, quantity and units (12 pack, 1lb, 2 liters, etc.)
* Make inputs so that new items can be added
Conditionally render the grocery items based on whether or not they were purchased (ok to have hard coded values for isPurchased)
* Add some style to your app
* Stretch: Add a button that says 'remove' and when clicked the value of isPurchased is toggled

STRETCH GOALS 
- [x] change the 'remove' button's functionality to actually remove the item from the list
- [x] add a 'later' button that toggles the CSS (gray text, strikeout etc.) if the item should be purchased later
- [x] expand your app to allow for images (the images should be an http URL ) and then render the image in your app - some images may take longer to load and not appear correctly, look into react life cycle events and/or lazy loading (if that is too much just keep trying images, some will work and save lifecycles/lazy loading for later)
- [ ] Make multiple grocery lists (one for each family member) and have them update independently
sort your list alphabetically
- [ ] create other ways to sort your data (i.e. by quantity)

## Final Submission
